There are no hidden fees, subscription charges, or premium tiers. All our code generation tools and resources are accessible to everyone at no cost."}]},{category:"Xtream Code Generator",questions:[{question:"What is an Xtream Code and why do I need it?",answer:"Xtream Codes is an API protocol used by many legitimate IPTV service providers to deliver streaming content. An Xtream code consists of a server URL, username, and password that authenticate your subscription. Many IPTV applications (like IPTV Smarters, TiviMate, Perfect Player) require these credentials in a specific format. Our Xtream Code Generator helps you organize and format these details correctly, ensuring seamless connection to your paid IPTV service."},{question:"How do I use the generated Xtream codes?",answer:"After generating your Xtream codes through our platform, you can use them in any compatible IPTV player application. Simply open your preferred IPTV app, select 'Add Playlist' or 'Login with Xtream Codes,' and enter the URL, username, and password we generated. The app will then connect to your IPTV provider's server and load your subscribed channels. We provide download options (TXT, image) and sharing features to make it easy to transfer these credentials to your devices."},{question:"Can I select a specific region for my Xtream codes?",answer:"Yes, our Xtream Code Generator includes a region selection feature. This allows you to generate codes optimized for specific geographic locations, which can improve streaming performance by connecting you to the nearest server. Region-specific codes may also provide access to localized content channels that are part of your subscription package. Simply select your preferred region before generating the codes."},{question:"What does the expiration date mean?",answer:"The expiration date indicates when your IPTV subscription or the generated credentials will expire. This is determined by your service provider and reflects the validity period of your paid subscription. After this date, you'll need to renew your subscription with your IPTV provider. Our generator displays this information to help you track when renewal is needed. We do not control or extend expiration dates—this is managed by your IPTV service provider."}]},{category:"Stalker Code Generator",questions:[{question:"What is Stalker middleware and how does it work?",answer:"Stalker (also known as MAG middleware) is a portal-based IPTV delivery system commonly used by set-top boxes and smart TV applications. Unlike Xtream codes, Stalker uses a combination of a portal URL and a MAC address for authentication. The portal URL is your IPTV provider's server address, while the MAC address uniquely identifies your device. Our Stalker Code Generator creates properly formatted virtual MAC addresses and portal configurations that work with STB Emulator apps and MAG devices."},{question:"What is a MAC address in IPTV context?",answer:"In IPTV terminology, a MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to your streaming device or application. For Stalker-based services, this MAC address is registered with your IPTV provider and linked to your subscription. When you connect to the portal, the server verifies your MAC address to authenticate your access. Our generator creates virtual MAC addresses in the correct format (00:1A:79:XX:XX:XX) that are compatible with STB Emulator applications and similar platforms."},{question:"Can I use Stalker codes on multiple devices?",answer:"This depends on your IPTV provider's subscription terms. Typically, each MAC address is tied to a single device or application instance. Some providers allow multiple device registrations under one subscription, while others limit access to one device at a time. Our generator can create codes for different devices, but you must ensure this complies with your provider's terms of service. Always check with your IPTV service provider regarding their multi-device policies."},{question:"Which apps support Stalker codes?",answer:"Stalker codes are compatible with various applications and devices, including STB Emulator (Android/iOS), MAG set-top boxes, Smart IPTV, and several other middleware-based players. The most popular application is STB Emulator, which simulates a MAG device on smartphones and tablets. After generating your Stalker codes through our platform, simply enter the portal URL and MAC address in your chosen application's settings to establish the connection."}]},{category:"Technical Support",questions:[{question:"Why isn't my generated code working?",answer:"If your generated code isn't working, several factors could be at play: (1) Verify that your IPTV subscription is active and hasn't expired. (2) Ensure you've entered the credentials exactly as generated, without extra spaces or typos. (3) Check that you're using a compatible IPTV application. (4) Confirm your internet connection is stable. (5) Some providers may have server maintenance or temporary outages. If problems persist, contact your IPTV service provider directly, as they manage the actual streaming service and can verify your subscription status."},{question:"How often can I regenerate codes?",answer:"You can regenerate codes as many times as needed at no cost. Our platform doesn't impose limits on code generation. However, keep in mind that regenerating codes doesn't extend your subscription or create new accounts—it simply reformats the connection details. The underlying subscription validity is controlled by your IPTV service provider. Regeneration is useful if you've lost your credentials, need to connect a new device, or want to switch to a different server region."},{question:"Do you store my generated codes or personal information?",answer:"No, we do not store your generated codes or personal credentials. Our code generation process is completely stateless and occurs entirely in your browser. Once you close the page or regenerate new codes, the previous information is not retained on our servers. We prioritize your privacy and security by ensuring that sensitive subscription details remain exclusively under your control. For more details, please review our comprehensive Privacy Policy."},{question:"What should I do if I detect an ad blocker warning?",answer:"Our platform displays an ad blocker detection notice because we rely on advertising revenue to maintain our free services. We kindly ask users to disable ad blockers for our site or add us to their whitelist. Our advertisements are carefully selected to be non-intrusive and don't interfere with the code generation process. Supporting us through ad views helps us continue providing free, high-quality tools and regularly update our platform with new features."}]},{category:"Privacy & Security",questions:[{question:"How do you protect my data?",answer:"We implement industry-standard security measures to protect user data.
